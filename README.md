Project Overview

This project creates dashboards to visualize Reddit data from WGU-related subreddits. Data includes users, posts, and comments, and subreddits updated weekly, focusing on analyzing comment scores relative to post scores and ranking comments across subreddits.

Objectives

	1.	Data Collection
	•	Use date ranges to prevent duplicate data.
	•	Fetch posts and comments for specific periods (e.g., 1-2 weeks back).
	2.	Data Analysis
	•	Score Normalization: Compare comment scores to post scores.
	•	Standardization: Use z-scores and percentiles for fair ranking.
	3.	Database Enhancements
	•	Update schema with fields for normalized scores and ranking metrics.
	•	Create database views for streamlined analysis.
	4.	Dashboard Development
	•	Build interactive visualizations for key metrics like comment impact and user activity.

Database Details

The SQLite database includes tables for subreddits, users, posts, and comments, with fields for scoring and tracking engagement.

Next Steps: Set up daily updates and build frontend visualizations.
