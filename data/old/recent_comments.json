Then, if the proctor tells you to navigate to your exam, tell them they have the link and to redirect you to it. If they dont, you just have to restart with a new proctor.\n\nYeah, its a bunch of bullshit",

                "content": "I'm young (22), and I did B&M at a school in my city. It was a great experience until I dropped out. I started school when covid had just started, and I think being online at that time really made me lose touch with doing any of the schoolwork. I was also in a bunch of bad places (mentally), but that's besides the point. When I finally went in person, I met so many people that I genuinely felt myself adapting to a sense of community. You'll meet so many determined people in college, and it rubs off on you. I decided to go with WGU because, after dropping out and working for a couple years, I found a job where I have 4 hours a day in a small office literally waiting for the clock out button to appear. I knew I wanted to do something, so I started a small business where I teach English online to foreigners. That definitely helps pass the time, but I always end up feeling like I'm just wasting away. A by-product of being a student, I guess. I tried a bunch of online courses, none of them enough to really feel substantial. I eventually found a channel called \"College Hacking\" and was genuinely intrigued. I went down a rabbit hole and found so many videos and information, I decided this was the best ROI that I was going to get on my time and money. I started on Nov 1st for a bachelor's in accounting. So far, while I've definitely talked to a bunch of people following a similar path to me, I have felt disconnected from others. I wouldn't say that's a bad thing, but it's there. It really brings out a sense of self motivation that I didn't feel in person. \n\nMy main point is that you are going to be sacrificing the experiences you would get in person, but you would also be getting the exact same thing it would take you 4 years to get. Why waste that time on a piece of paper? I didn't have time while leveraging a full-time job to go and take classes in person at a college near me. It just wouldn't work. WGU was the best solution for me.",

I've said good things about WGU to my coworkers and have even recommended it.\n\nBut if I could go back in time and force my 18 year old self to go to college would I enroll him in WGU?

Also as a woman you have a timer on you, as sad as it is. If I went to a traditional school I would waste four years of my life, and it would be impossible to build myself up to a point of becoming a millionaire, retiring my parents, and getting married before I'm 30. I know you can't become a millionaire by working for others but I already have a job set up that will pay me 100k+ a year (pray this works out for me lol), and then I'm going to open my own business.

At a b&m school, you can develop ongoing relationships with actual professors and do things like independent study courses or contribute to research and get letters of recommendation even at a basic public university and you'll be able to do more networking with classmates since most people are full time and on campus. Most have actual career service centers that will assist you with things like resume writing and may have exclusive job listings for internships and new grad roles. Also depsite what people continually try to claim, the degree does **not** translate to a 3.0 GPA . It's up to the organization reviewing your degree and transcript to decide if they think it's equivalent and there are a lot of jobs that do in fact ask for 3.0 GPA or higher especially in government roles. This isn't to knock WGU, like I said it's great for what it offers which is an affordable and timely way for working professionals and non traditional students to get a degree and enter a career field or become more competitive for a promotion",

The majority of the population wants to grind out their bachelor asap and go to work. Even if you want to pursue a phd degree, you can get your undergrad with wgu and apply to a b&m school to get your grad degrees and do all the research you want.\n\nYour classmates are not going to help you land a job. If you need a recommendation letter, I\u2019m sure your program mentor and/or course instructors are more than happy to write one.\n\nWgu has handshake for job search and a full career development service. What you want to do with your career is on you. You got to make the effort of selling yourself to land a job.\n\nWgu is a pass/fail school, there is no gpa. If you are scared of employers looking down on wgu degrees then don\u2019t enroll to wgu. Even if that\u2019s the case, then I wouldn\u2019t want to work for that employer.",

Psychology program guide to see a Standard Path for the courses, which would be a non-accelerated estimated timeline of the courses:\nhttps://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/health-professions/BSPSY.pdf\n\nAlso, transfer courses from WGU's partner learning providers can give the opportunity to earn credit before starting a degree program that may have a higher tuition cost than the cost of the learning provider courses. \n\nSavings aren't the only goal of learning provider courses; for example one of WGU's partner learning providers, Study.com, makes efforts to [design its courses for learning effectiveness](https://study.com/blog/how-study-com-uses-learning-science-research-to-design-effective-experiences.html), a pattern I noticed when I was taking Study.com courses before starting the Computer Science program at WGU.\n\nTo find transfer possibilities for the B.S. Psychology program from WGU's partner learning providers Sophia and Study.com, you can check out WGU's Transfer Pathways Agreement pages.\n\nWGU's Transfer Pathways Agreement pages for Sophia and Study.com-provided courses, among others, can be found from [partners.wgu.edu](https://partners.wgu.edu) by following the link with the provider's name in the National Agreements section, expanding the Leavitt School of Health section on the next page, then following the \"Available ACE Approved courses\" link after the \"BS Psychology (Catalog 04-2024)\" text.\n\nI also posted this thread on r/studydotcom that shows Sophia and Study.com courses that I found from those pages:\n[Transfer a Crew of Credits to the BS Psychology at WGU](https://www.reddit.com/r/studydotcom/comments/1c9mrfq/transfer_a_crew_of_credits_to_the_bs_psychology/).\n\nIf you want to transfer courses before starting at WGU, you could compare the courses required for the B.S. Psychology program to the courses available with the learning providers. After finding and completing transfer courses from a learning provider, you can send the transcript from the learning provider to WGU to be evaluated for credit towards the program requirements.",

I'm paraphrasing but they said it is truly only a small percentage that receive excellence awards, only first submissions are eligible (meaning your paper cannot have been sent back for revisions), and you usually have to write something that is a truly unique or innovative perspective that the majority of papers do not reach. You are likely just a gifted writer who also grasps the course material/scenario very well. Out of my 20+ papers I've only received 1 excellence award.\n\nThey also shared that just because an evaluator submits your paper for an award, doesn't guarantee you will receive one. The paper is simply passed up the chain to be evaluated by higher ups before any award is given.",

I even had one evaluator write like three sentences worth of comments about how great my work was and they used several strong adjectives to describe it. Still no award for almost a year.\u00a0\n\n\nI feel like most of the ones I've seen posted that included the evaluator comments alluded to diversity or marginalized groups in some way, so that's important to keep in mind too. It may not necessarily be that the work itself is that much better but that they're just getting \"good-boy pats\" for saying the right things. It's also hard to determine how much artistic license you have to deviate from to rubric to make it unique before it just becomes...incorrect. Sometimes I feel there isn't enough information in the scenario to really answer a question and I end up making a lot of assumptions or describing possible extrapolated scenarios, which could go either way. Same thing with \"excellence\"; you either meet the rubric requirements or not...How can you exceed them while staying within them?\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I finally did get my one and only award, it was because of D078 task 1. I went into quite a bit of detail about how my team design/each member would allow the company to achieve it's goal, as in what each one would contribute and how the others would then interact with or use that input. I honestly felt like it was crappy and pedantic when I wrote it but without it I felt like that section had nothing, so I left it in. I sure needed that award for motivation because it was the first work I submitted in 4.5 months that term.\u00a0",

I'm not saying it's not harder for CompSci grads to get a job(it is), but this is also an echo chamber with a doomer mentality.\n\nFrankly, if you like CS enough, you will make something work. Will you get a developer job? Maybe, but you'll have to bust your ass and create things that aren't standard project todos list #100. Luck and the way you interview also plays a part. If you only have technical skills but no soft skills, you will be hard to teach.\n\nIt is a numbers game. Get out, get an IT job, and springboard from there. The market is hard, and you have to be scrappy and do what you can. Those who don't know their \"why's\" are dropping out of the race like flies. I can't promise you that it will get better, but if you work hard enough, you will find a job. It's just not 2020 levels of \"free job\" after school.\n\nHackathons, network, get out to career fairs.

It still is a decent job for people doing it, but it's not clear what it will be like in the near future.\n\nBut computer science was only ever at best a mediocre fit as a training program for web developers. At core it is still a rigorous, math- and theory-heavy technical degree. Even if web development dries up (it probably will somewhat but not completely), there is still the entire rest of programming and software development to do. And it prepares you well for a lot of different kinds of work. It checks the \"has a degree\" box that is the gateway to all white collar jobs in the US.",

                "content": "I didn't ask if you enjoy learning.  I asked if you went into comp sci because you enjoy comp sci, or solely because you thought it would be lucrative.  I can't really ask anything more specific or give more specifics on the market, because I don't know what part of the field you're looking to work in (SWE, embedded systems, cyber, etc), but the point I was trying to make is that it's not the automatically lucrative career path that people seem to think it is.  That's a skewed perception created by high paid outliers, especially in SWE roles.    \n  \nIf you went in solely because you thought it would be lucrative, you should consider looking for something that's more stable and actually lucrative, because it's hard to break into the field right now and it taking a year or more to get that first job is not unheard of.  Which is fine if it's a field you really want to work in and are willing to wait that long and do all the extra work, but most people I know who went in expecting money and not because they enjoyed the field ended up pivoting to something else (usually accounting).",

                "content": "You're so close! Focus on probability and regression, they both make up half the OA. I found the cohort videos extremely useful. Watch them through on 2x speed but pause on the practice problems and work them out yourself before seeing the answer. There's an entire one dedicated to probability and that one really drove it home for me. The learning material has a ton of practice questions too, honestly do those til you're blue in the face. The questions are structured similarly to the OA. \n\nAt the beginning of the exam, brain dump as many formulas onto your whiteboard as possible. That way you can go through focusing on the questions instead of constantly reminding yourself of the formulas. And go over the key concepts guide that the CI should have given you. If you can explain what each thing is and can confidently work out a problem from it, you will pass. The formulas you need to know are also in there. Those are the ones to cram right before your exam and then dump onto the whiteboard as soon as the proctor loads you in.\n\nThe probability questions are tough due to the wording. There are key words in the problem that will tell you what formula to use. Then it's basic math. Just make sure to read those slowly, I personally read it and re-read it before solving. One word will make the difference in what they're asking for.",

It took me 3 tries and if this is your first time taking it, you will definitely pass the second time. You got this!",

So these are some things you can do to greatly improve your chances.\n\n1.  Specialize in AI.  That includes knowing how to use it, but more importantly knowing how to deploy it.  It\u2019s the hot field and it\u2019s not going away.  So do projects and lots of research.\n\n2. Or Cyber security, the other hot field.  Learn everything you can about it, get certs, do projects.\n\n\n3.  Somewhat decent option, development.  Again, you will need a serious portfolio.  You will still want to know AI.\n\nPick one of those 3.\n\nFor whichever you pick, make a GitHub and Dow. Lot of projects.  Be active in their respective communities and accumulate stars on your GitHub.  Anyone hiring in those fields can easily see a good employee from their GitHub.  It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s a clear way in.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is build out your LinkedIn.  It\u2019s incredibly annoying but it\u2019s a necessary evil.  If you don\u2019t have one now, open one.  Start posting random positive crap on it.  Never post anything negative, only positive, corporate propaganda.  That is what they want to see.  Follow companies, engage with posts.  Play the game.  Most employers will look at your LinkedIn before an interview.",

It\u2019s the same story different day.\n\nMuch like real estate, everything has high and low waves. \n\nIf you love the career you won\u2019t work a day in your life and it will be a different market sooner than later.\n\nMy prediction is that AI will make more jobs. Business folks are very short sighted and think AI is a magic bullet but after playing with it, it is smart and incredibly dumb at the same time.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t replace a software engineer but makes things faster and more efficient.\n\nFinish your degree and stop looking at LinkedIN. Use the WGU internal or other job boards. \n\nGoto network events regarding technologies you like and meet PEOPLE.\n\nMost jobs are obtained by meeting people in person and then vouching for you with their boss/hiring manager.\n\nThis too shall pass and it will be a different market. \n\nMake your own portfolio projects, network with people, sharpen your skills and you\u2019ll be ready for the next hiring wave.",

I\u2019ve worked with many college grads that have little to no practical experience and they ended up getting canned.

Start small on a helpdesk, preferably in law/banking/gov, and move up from there. There is a lot of value to being trusted with PII. Also, internships are wonderful so don\u2019t be afraid to be underpaid for a while. Lastly, don\u2019t be afraid to move. If you don\u2019t find jobs in your area, look in others.

I hired a junior dev at my last job.\n\nWe were excited to hire them because they took a lot of initiative in putting together their own projects, for instance a blog and some open source work. It\u2019s not a fair system because it revolves around working for free, but so is internships, and you don\u2019t need an internship to work for free in open source. You can\u2019t set your own schedule with an internship either.\n\nAnyway, the pluses and minuses of this reality aside, it is effective.

A career change at 40 given the current market was too tough for me. \n\nThat said, others have found success - I thought long and hard. Its a dog eat dog market for developers.  Too much micromanagement, too much return to office. Too much stress to keep up with - lol.",

Take any volunteer opportunities and just tell recruiters they were a real job (HR can be arbitrary about volunteer experience counting as experience only because it doesn't pay, its dumb), hell make an LLC and list yourself as an engineer and consult your services to people to create experience in light of a crappy job market.   \n  \nPoint of all this being, don't let the lack of job opportunities right now be a deterrent to not find other pathways to progress in the industry. If you want work in the field, it will happen eventually.  \n  \nPersonally, I'm surviving off gig work, and am using all my downtime to master leetcode for when the market gets better.

To add to that, you have no experience so once you graduate you will have a tough time finding a job.  You can increase your odds by being extremely flexible.  What you need in the beginning is experience, not money.  So, take any job that is IT related and build up some kind of experience.  Also, forget about working remotely. Apply to jobs that are in-office five days a week.  Those have less applicants.  Finally, I will say that as a new graduate don't focus on money.  That's not important right now.

The classes do build on eachother and I have learned a ton. im in Intermediate Accounting 1 now.\nI usually search reddit for 'WGU CourseNumber' and see the best way to approach a class. some you can just watch the webinars or cohorts in the course search. some i go through all the course material and module quizzes and unit tests. know the concepts and why and how things work and relate, dont just memorize answers. Join the Facebook group, WGU Accelerators. My mentor is awesome, she helps me a lot, when i need motivation i make sure to have weekly calls to keep me accountable.ive only actually talked to a course instructor once but it was helpful. i do try and join live cohorts or other events when i get emails about them, those have been helpful for me also.  2 terms i slacked and only got 3 classes done in each. ive done 10 classes in the last 12 weeks now i think. and still have 2 months to finish this term.for the accounting classes the course material and embedded videos have been the most useful for me. I usually have 2 classes open at once, one with a PA and one with an OA, sometimes i just need a change of pace and a different topic for a day or 2 so i'll work on the other. sorry for the long rambling on message but hopefully this is somewhat helpful to you.",

I'm switching my major to accounting next term (which will be Jan for me)\n\nI'm coming from the college of IT and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell you how saturated tech is, especially SWE, which *was* essentially my end goal. Like many I was chasing the high entry level salary, and to me, I've realized it's not that important to me anymore, especially with the grind to get internships and a job. I think my frontal lobe just developed on my birthday this year lol\n\nI've just been thinking about my goals in life lately, and I truly don't think I have a calling or a passion for any career like I thought I did all through high school and my first unrelated degree. I just want a job that can provide for my family, at the end of the day, like another commenter said, needing to get on a career trajectory. My main passions or callings fall outside of any career related thing. It seems like this career is more so a delayed gratification one, and I'm okay with that",

The Pluralsight material for each is not very comprehensive. What really helped me pass was following the learning path on Microsoft Learn. I did that for like 10 days for the AZ-104 course and finished it. From there, I spammed the Microsoft practice exam as it is way more like the OA than any other resource I used.\n\nThe takeaway for me here is to focus on the learning path from Microsoft Learn for these Azure certs. I have the cert test for the AZ-104 tomorrow and I feel pretty confident.",

Additionally the code editor in the OA is particular with the white space/newlines, which you'll get the hang of better if you use the provided material.\n\nIf you wanted to go more in depth on the subject I would go through through the Zybooks and supplement with external material on sections you feel you didn't grasp. The key to this course is to get repetitions in, make sure you do the practice tests at the end and the OA multiple times",

I haven\u2019t had any experience in IT/ Help desk at ALL, but I did have some customer service experience (retail, medical front desk, etc), and I got a job as a Help desk agent. Even before accepting, I was getting lots of interviews as well with no prior IT or Help desk experience. \n\nSo long as you have experience with customer service, and the service you give is good, you\u2019ll be able to get a Help desk job. Especially if you have any certs as well, that\u2019s a big plus. Keep in mind I\u2019ve been at the WGU BSCSIA for less than a year, only have A+, and in my early 20\u2019s. \n\nEven if you dont have experience, try to \u201cemphasize\u201d a little bit of anything related to customer service with your previous jobs. Anything at all. Be open to anything, possibly even relocating if the opportunity is too good to pass. Good luck man you got it. Best of luck!",

By 22 I grabbed the Net+ and Sec+, Blue Team Analyst Cert, and finished by Bachelor's in Cyber Sec.

Multiple people's kid I'm friends with, +20 never been employed before expecting to hop right into a 9-5. Cyber Sec jobs want you to have IT experience. IT wants you to have helpdesk experience. Helpdesk wants you to have customer service experience literally anywhere. And that literally anywhere is the job you had from 16-20 years old. The issue is, a lot of 22-24 year olds don't want to start at the bottom of the ladder making $15 an hour for the first job like they should've 7 years prior.",
