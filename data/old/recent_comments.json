Then, if the proctor tells you to navigate to your exam, tell them they have the link and to redirect you to it. If they dont, you just have to restart with a new proctor.\n\nYeah, its a bunch of bullshit",

Psychology program guide to see a Standard Path for the courses, which would be a non-accelerated estimated timeline of the courses:\nhttps://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/health-professions/BSPSY.pdf\n\nAlso, transfer courses from WGU's partner learning providers can give the opportunity to earn credit before starting a degree program that may have a higher tuition cost than the cost of the learning provider courses. \n\nSavings aren't the only goal of learning provider courses; for example one of WGU's partner learning providers, Study.com, makes efforts to [design its courses for learning effectiveness](https://study.com/blog/how-study-com-uses-learning-science-research-to-design-effective-experiences.html), a pattern I noticed when I was taking Study.com courses before starting the Computer Science program at WGU.\n\nTo find transfer possibilities for the B.S. Psychology program from WGU's partner learning providers Sophia and Study.com, you can check out WGU's Transfer Pathways Agreement pages.\n\nWGU's Transfer Pathways Agreement pages for Sophia and Study.com-provided courses, among others, can be found from [partners.wgu.edu](https://partners.wgu.edu) by following the link with the provider's name in the National Agreements section, expanding the Leavitt School of Health section on the next page, then following the \"Available ACE Approved courses\" link after the \"BS Psychology (Catalog 04-2024)\" text.\n\nI also posted this thread on r/studydotcom that shows Sophia and Study.com courses that I found from those pages:\n[Transfer a Crew of Credits to the BS Psychology at WGU](https://www.reddit.com/r/studydotcom/comments/1c9mrfq/transfer_a_crew_of_credits_to_the_bs_psychology/).\n\nIf you want to transfer courses before starting at WGU, you could compare the courses required for the B.S. Psychology program to the courses available with the learning providers. After finding and completing transfer courses from a learning provider, you can send the transcript from the learning provider to WGU to be evaluated for credit towards the program requirements.",

I'm not saying it's not harder for CompSci grads to get a job(it is), but this is also an echo chamber with a doomer mentality.\n\nFrankly, if you like CS enough, you will make something work. Will you get a developer job? Maybe, but you'll have to bust your ass and create things that aren't standard project todos list #100. Luck and the way you interview also plays a part. If you only have technical skills but no soft skills, you will be hard to teach.\n\nIt is a numbers game. Get out, get an IT job, and springboard from there. The market is hard, and you have to be scrappy and do what you can. Those who don't know their \"why's\" are dropping out of the race like flies. I can't promise you that it will get better, but if you work hard enough, you will find a job. It's just not 2020 levels of \"free job\" after school.\n\nHackathons, network, get out to career fairs.

So these are some things you can do to greatly improve your chances.\n\n1.  Specialize in AI.  That includes knowing how to use it, but more importantly knowing how to deploy it.  It\u2019s the hot field and it\u2019s not going away.  So do projects and lots of research.\n\n2. Or Cyber security, the other hot field.  Learn everything you can about it, get certs, do projects.\n\n\n3.  Somewhat decent option, development.  Again, you will need a serious portfolio.  You will still want to know AI.\n\nPick one of those 3.\n\nFor whichever you pick, make a GitHub and Dow. Lot of projects.  Be active in their respective communities and accumulate stars on your GitHub.  Anyone hiring in those fields can easily see a good employee from their GitHub.  It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s a clear way in.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is build out your LinkedIn.  It\u2019s incredibly annoying but it\u2019s a necessary evil.  If you don\u2019t have one now, open one.  Start posting random positive crap on it.  Never post anything negative, only positive, corporate propaganda.  That is what they want to see.  Follow companies, engage with posts.  Play the game.  Most employers will look at your LinkedIn before an interview.",

I did that for like 10 days for the AZ-104 course and finished it. From there, I spammed the Microsoft practice exam as it is way more like the OA than any other resource I used.\n\nThe takeaway for me here is to focus on the learning path from Microsoft Learn for these Azure certs.

The key to this course is to get repetitions in, make sure you do the practice tests at the end and the OA multiple times",

It really is important! Also, once you learn it - it seems so simple.\n\nI'd be willing to say that knowing how to subnet is more important than memorizing common TCP/UDP ports. Spend the time to get decent at converting binary to decimal and vice versa. It's really not as crazy or difficult as it initially seems.",
