I'll help you design a project structure for maintaining and visualizing this WGU Reddit database. Let me break this down into key components.

Let me break down the project design into its core components:

├── db/
│   └── WGU_Reddit.db
└── docker/
    ├── Dockerfile.backend
    ├── Dockerfile.frontend
    └── docker-compose.yml

Key Components:

A. Data Collection (Scripts)

Daily scheduler using either GitHub Actions or cron
Script to fetch new posts since last update
Script to fetch new comments for existing posts
Database update mechanisms with error handling

B. Backend (FastAPI)

RESTful API endpoints for:

Posts with filtering and pagination
Comments with post relationships
Subreddit statistics
User activity metrics


Database connection management
Data validation and error handling

C. Frontend (React)

Dashboard with:

Post listing with filters
Comment viewer
Subreddit statistics
Search functionality
User activity visualizations



Let me create a sample React dashboard component to demonstrate the visualization aspect:

Implementation Plan:

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

Set up GitHub repository structure
Create basic FastAPI backend with database connections
Implement data update scripts
Set up GitHub Actions for automated updates

Phase 2: API Development

Implement all REST endpoints
Add data filtering and pagination
Create API documentation
Add error handling and logging

Phase 3: Frontend Development

Build dashboard UI
Implement data visualization components
Add filtering and search functionality
Create responsive design

Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring

Set up Docker containers
Configure CI/CD pipeline
Implement monitoring and error tracking
Add database backup system


Required Technologies:


Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, PRAW (Reddit API)
Frontend: React, Recharts, Tailwind CSS
DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions
Monitoring: Sentry or similar

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components or create additional sample code for specific parts of the system? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Bit sounds like you're proposing a react dashboard.  tell me more about it, why you recommend that over other options.EditLet me explain my recommendation for a React dashboard and compare it with alternatives.

To illustrate what's possible with React, let me create a more detailed example of a key dashboard component - a post analysis view that shows engagement metrics:

The React dashboard approach offers several specific benefits for your WGU Reddit project:

Data Handling

Easy integration with your SQLite database through an API
Efficient handling of real-time updates from your daily scraping
Smooth filtering and searching across 11,000+ posts


User Experience

Fast, responsive interface
Interactive filtering and sorting
Real-time updates without page refreshes
Mobile-friendly design


Development Benefits

Component-based architecture matches your data structure (posts, comments, users)
Strong TypeScript support for your database schema
Easy to add new features as your project grows
Great testing tools


Community Support

Large ecosystem of UI components
Extensive documentation
Active community for problem-solving



Would you like me to:

Show more specific components (like the comment viewer or user statistics)?
Demonstrate how to integrate it with your SQLite database?
Explore a different technology stack if React doesn't align with your needs?

Dashboard Implementation PlanClick to open document
Let me create a sample implementation of one of the key shared components - the FilterBar - to demonstrate the level of functionality we're aiming for:

To use this project plan effectively:

Start with Core Components

Begin with the Layout and basic Dashboard components
This gives you a working foundation to build upon


Implement in Phases

Follow the day-by-day breakdown
Each phase builds on the previous one
Test thoroughly as you go


Focus on Data Flow

Implement the API integration early
Use React Query for data fetching and caching
Handle loading and error states properly


Component Best Practices

Keep components focused and single-purpose
Use TypeScript for better type safety
Write tests for critical components
Document props and functionality
