What will give you a run for your money are the supply chain (upper division) courses. The textbooks are insanely long and there are little to no resources other than the textbook. You will find that the OA's are just completely out of alignment with PA's. 

I made a guide for one of the data courses just because of how poorly the rubric and instructions are set up, if i didnt have a bg in analytics i would have been screwed.

Edit: I've worked in supply chain & struggled the most with the supply chain courses, how funny is that?? The reality is that supply chain doesn't work ""by the book"" and you often have to come up with solutions on the fly that dont align with textbook definitions.
