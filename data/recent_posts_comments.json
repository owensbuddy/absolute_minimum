The best thing about WGU is that high stakes testing and no required course work are perfect for those of us with work experience of the program competencies. There are probably some classes that you won't even need to look at the material to pass the OA or do the project/paper. I've had a few classes that had competencies of things I actively do in my current role on a daily basis. A quick once-over of terminology to make sure the test wouldn't use language i wasn't familiar with and we were straight onto the practice test. After that I did a quick review of the questions I missed and then scheduled the test based on my confidence level of the material. \n\nAs an operations manager, I expect your going to experience a lot of the same.

I like to set mine on Sundays, and then see if I can get it done by Friday. If so, I get the whole weekend off to play. \n\nCouple of advantages:\nBy starting with minimal standards, you know you'll stay on track to graduate, even if life interferes and you can't focus on studying for a time.\n\nBite-sized goals are achievable, and it minimizes the overwhelm.\n\nEvery time you beat your deadline, you have accelerated. Maybe only by two days, but you *have* accelerated. Now, do it again. :)\n\nHTH",

I had to do all the off boarding HR and IT.\u00a0\n\n\nAll while maintaining 24/7 365 support for everything and keeping up with my various roles within the org and adding new ones every time we let a key player go I took over some aspects of their roles (accounting team goes guess who got AP and AR roles added)\n\n\nThe point is that we are never ready for these things and just doing it is so much more important.\u00a0\n\n\nBeing a parent is the most important thing you can ever do. The good thing is your baby is young enough she will be allowed in the room with you for exams if you need it. And you will be setting a great example for her on how to achieve in life. Plus, your degree will directly improve her life and yours.\n\n\nIt is not going to be easy and you will accelerate at times and others you will barely be able to sit down and log in. But in the end you will do it and that feeling when you realize you did or the day when you look at yourself and realize that WGU made you better than you were before is the best feeling.\u00a0\n\n\nYou will learn ways to cope here but you will mostly just figure out your own groove and what works for your life.\u00a0\n\n\nJust be prepared to learn why they call us night owls. :) and see you on the other side!",

All you just have to do is show up daily, no matter how small, no matter how little, show up. Think of it like this; for some of you it may take 1 year, others 6 months, others 3 months, others even 2 years. But at the end won\u2019t it feel good to look back and see how far you\u2019ve come? How much you\u2019ve learned, how much you can teach or how much you can code or calculate? So no matter how you feel right now try as much as you can to persevere regardless of what\u2019s happening cos at the end it\u2019ll be so worth it. I understand that studying especially online without anyone to hold you accountable is hard, some of you have kids, some have jobs and kids, it\u2019s all part of the process. Remember your why and try to be disciplined enough, motivation would get you started but discipline would keep you going. Put down the video games, put down the anime, put down the Netflix, put down TikTok and IG reels, put down YouTube(unless you\u2019re using it to learn) don\u2019t rest in the middle cos you can mess up ur dopamine receptors, rest at the end and you\u2019ll feel much more better about yourself.

        "selftext": "This course can be challenging to navigate, so I decided to write this small guide to help my fellow Night Owls out.\n\nFirst of all, there's no need to watch or read anything in the course material. Instead, open up the Announcements tab and find the three-part video series created by Mr. Nichols. The three parts line up to the three sections you'll find in the course content. Simply watch through all of those videos and you'll learn everything you need to know for the OA. I've attached a screenshot of the video series, so you can know how to locate them in the Announcements tab.\n\nAfter you've watched through  all of the videos at least once, email your Course Instructor and ask for the three quizzes that align with the three-part video series. Take the quizzes and take the Pre-Assesment also. Then, make flashcards aligning with the content within the quizzes and the Pre-Assesment.\n\nStudy the flashcards everyday while watching through the all of the videos two more times to completion. After that, you should be ready to pass the Objective Assessment.\n\nUsing these strategies and resources, I passed the Objective Assessment with an Exemplary after 8 days in the course. This course is pretty straightforward if you know what to study. You can do it, Night Owl! I believe in you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rn4vt4gu7ezd1.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=62fdbb89591f83c067fbc88c02b5b0b553aae726\n\n",

For me I've been having to wait to even get a proctor for 15 minutes up to but I have seen some people saying that they had to wait for up to 2 hours. That has nothing to do with your PC. \n\nI had different proctors switching out during my test and the pop-up chat coming up and blinking red saying that someone else is in the room every 30 seconds to 2 minutes throughout my test which was very distracting again had nothing to do with your PC. \n\nI've had a few proctors that were extraordinarily rude and had me take full videos of my room over and over and over again again, nothing to do with my PC.\n\nI've had two tests where there was a screeching noise coming from the proctor's microphone throughout my entire test. Again, nothing to do with my PC\n\nI went to the community college before this never had a single issue with proctorio. And then when I first started, WGU didn't have any issues with the proctering system until they switched. \n\nPersonally, I would go to another college if I had another option, but where I live the nearest college is an hour and a half away not including traffic.",

Now I'm a technical person and I am fortunate enough to have 5 computers, and I found one that works now.\n\nI shouldn't HAVE to have 5 computers to get one that works.

But for a lot of courses the material doesn't match up that well with what's on the OA, incentivizing you to skip the valuable stuff to focus on memorizing syntax trivia to get through the class. It's not great but if you're determined to learn something you have the tools, just not a built in reason to.\n\nFor the more \"practical\" courses using java I haven't done much of them yet but IMO it doesn't matter that much. People don't really learn to code in a CS program they just fight through it and come out the other side. No one is expecting mastery of modern professional software tools from fresh CS grads. Bare competence in a couple languages and good problem solving skills are all.",

I had to appeal to the military for an extension because WGU said \u201cwe can give you 7 more days\u201d. According to my mentor.the military gave me a 90 day extension for birth.\n\nI was like dude if 7 more days would make a difference I wouldn\u2019t need the extension lol",

Per my enrollment counselor, I had to complete orientation and meet with my mentor before Nov 1st. Orientation was completed before then but my mentor's schedule was very limited so I couldn't meet with her before the 1st. Went in last week to schedule something with her and the earliest availability is the end of the month. I went ahead and scheduled it but I feel like I'm wasting a whole month if I wait until meeting with her.\n\nSo can I start taking classes without meeting with her? BS in CS if that helps.",

        "selftext": "I am just curious if others have had a similar experience to my own.  I am currently enrolled in the M.S. IT Management program.  I have a decent amount of experience in the industry and have completed 6 courses in my first term so far.  I am pretty happy with my progress.  I would not call myself an accelerator but I am completing some courses faster than others.  In classes that cover information I do not know from my work experience, I try to reasonably take my time to better retain the information in the course.  I have had the same course instructor in 3 of the classes, and he often sends emails along the lines of \"You started this class 2 weeks ago.  Students should be able to complete the course in 2 weeks.  When will you submit your tasks?\"  In some instance, I have already submitted the first or second tasks so I assume the emails may be on some sort of automated schedule.  To clarify, this is in reference to the course instructor for specific courses and not my student mentor.  I generally respond with something along the lines of, \"I will submit my tasks soon all good on this end\".  I don't particularly like feeling rushed in a course though when I am already ahead of schedule in a term.  I also find some of these timelines in the emails un-realistic given the amount of content in some of the courses.  I was advised that other course instructors in these classes do not push for the same timeline as this professor.  It makes me wonder if you complete courses at a certain speed, if WGU assigns you to a more time intensive course instructor for additional courses in your term.  ",

When I received my undergraduate degree a few years ago through WGU, I never really had a course instructor push for these oddly fast timelines in a course.  Since your pace is typically a discussion between you and your student mentor.  Glad to hear I am not the only one though.  It is a bit surprising to me though that some course instructors push students to complete classes so quickly.  I understand some students may need that as motivation to stay on task in the class.  At the end of the day though WGU gets less money if I complete several courses in a single term.\n\nAs an aside, my post is in reference to a course instructor.  My student mentor is awesome.  I originally typed \"course mentor\" in my post so that's on me.",

I completed 9 classes in the first month of this term, and I'm on a unexpected break at the moment to deal with some personal stuff (which my mentor is well aware of) before coming back to finish my last 8 classes, so I'm not \"behind\" by any means. \n\nAs long as you communicate with your mentor about your goals and degree progression, you can either just ignore the course instructors or tell them to leave you alone.\n\nETA: my usual response to annoying course instructors is simply, \"I'll reach out if I need anything.\" And they take the hint.",

Some courses are considered easy but it really depends on if you know the material or not. For a lot of us at WGU we are already working in the same field as our degree or have prior knowledge/ experience which is why you'll see I completed my bachelor's in 6 months type posts. \n\n\nIs it fast? Like what I said above it depends on you. \n\nIs it cheap? I am not paying for the majority of school, the military is so my out of pocket is small enough I don't need loans. I still think it's relatively cheap for what you get. You do all 4 courses in your term and you can just keep going which has saved me a term.\n\nI would suggest taking a look at the programs your interested in and asking about those specific programs.\n\nPersonally my experience has been amazing. My mentor is awesome. I have had very few issues with online proctoring (that is a thing here) and I do feel like I am actually learning. I am in the B.S. IT program. If you have any specific questions I will I'll try to answer them.",

But it's still a great question to ask.  \nIn my opinion and experience, WGU was what was best for me and provided me the tools to accelerate my learning to lightning fast. I didn't even have transferred credits. It really fit my learning style and they were able to stick to my pace, whatever that may have been.\n\nSo, I'd recommend WGU, but I have literally 0 info on the other schools you mentioned, and I'm biased. Happy hunting!",

Just make sure you don't add anything that you can't finish. \n\nI have never done a paper so I can't comment on that. \n\nThe real exams are proctored while the practice ones are not. There is no \"good faith\". You have to have a webcam, scan your space and have an ID to show. It's really not that bad. The only problems I've had is that my proctors were Indian and I had trouble with their accents and one time I got into an argument with them trying to show them my desktop which was glowing with LEDs at the time lol.",

My first week I \"did\" seven classes in three days because it was just a matter of smashing an OA on material I had mastered through my career.\n\nThis is a really different approach and experience from people who *are* learning the material as they go, but still attempting to accelerate by putting in extra hours or optimizing study to the tests. These are two very different kinds of accelerators, so when people talk about accelerating take a minute to figure out which kind they are.

        "selftext": "This first class is insane. The first objective is to examine a dataset. My last experience with descriptive statistics was AP Stats in highschool, almost seven years ago. I thought there'd be more explanation on how to graph relationships dependent on whether data is categorical or numerical. I've come to understand that continuous numerical data is much more easily visualized with the methodologies employed in the lesson videos. \n\nBeing an idiot, I decided to use a data set they provided that is full of binary categorical data. I'm doing the first project and it's taken me three days to understand a chi-squared value test and what it implies, how to make a function that takes two columns from a dataframe and spits out formatted results for a chi-squared test.\n\nAdd another day for making a function to plot bar charts of expected versus actual cross tabs.\n\nI've finally gotten around to making a correlation matrix of the binary categorical variables, and at least Pearson's correlation was somewhat easier to understand. Though it did take me 2 hours of Google searching to arrive at the conclusion that using Pearson's for binary categorical data is fine because you end up with the Phi value.\n\nI've also looked through the lessons on data visualization multiple times and can't see any instances where the instructors or interactive workspaces use seaborn, so I've elected not to use it even though their Jupyter kernel has it installed. I've read so much matplotlib documentation in the past 5 hours, my eyes might fall out. \n\nAnyway all this is to say that I'm slowly going insane, my brain is full of central measures, r's,  p's, phi's and chi's. I feel like there was a class before this that I missed somehow.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips? Has anyone had a similar experience?\n\nP.S. Send coffee. Please.",

Communicate with your program mentor & course instructor. Read the course discussion chats, tips, etc on the right hand side. Make checklists for daily, weekly and monthly objectives & check it off whenever you complete them. Also try and reward/treat yourself for small victories (positive reinforcement). If you've submitting all the PAs for a course, contact program mentor immediately to get another course added to your program plan. Most of the time, revisions shouldn't take too long. On that note, when writing papers, create an outline for your paper based on the assessment objective questions/how it is listed on the rubric. \n\nA. Identify ......\n\nYour response to A....\n\nA1. Describe each ....\n\nWhere you flesh out your response to A with more context\n\nAnd so on. If you're reading any site, or looking at any material related to whatever you're writing about, copy the link and throw it into the sources page. You can put it in the appropriate format later but you don't want to get anything kicked back for plagiarism or AI content.\n\nHope this helps!",

Loads of study guides to complete before CI's approval. D196 failed it once, not touching that for now. So, I decided to take D076 and I've been studying for a week. A lot of materials to cover. I feel like I'm drowning. But I see the finish line. 31st December is my last day. Any assistance, help, advice or even notes will help. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a ",

        "selftext": "Last night, I finished up D427 and decided to start D333 and take the practice assessment before bed. I was hoping that the class would be basic common sense and that I'd be able to complete it in a day. Unfortunately, that was not the case since I failed the PA. After that, I checked here on Reddit and found that this class seems to give a lot of people some trouble. So, I went to bed and started today watching YouTube videos I had seen linked in another post while I was at work. I went through the whole playlist twice at 1.5 speed during my workday. After watching that I took the PA again and this time I passed, but just barely! So the plan is tomorrow I will read up on the sections I'm struggling with and try again. As a general rule of thumb, I like to have a bit of wiggle room on my PA score before I try the actual OA. It seems my weakest section is Explains Professional Ethical Codes so if anyone has any tips or study material that worked for them I would appreciate any help! I plan on attempting the OA tomorrow evening as I'd like to finish this class quickly.",

My college basically told me I can take any class from any accredited University so I know WGU would be accepted. I am looking to take Intro to Statistics or one of the single course offerings. Since I am already enrolled in a degree plan here at my current college I would be able to take 1 course right? If anybody every has please let me know! \n\nThank you all",

We covered the basics like PC components and HTML in elementary, then studied about basics of python and making projects in high school for my grades. My plan is to spend this summer on TryHackMe, relearning Python cause i forgot everything, and picking up other skills needed for pentesting cause im interested in pentesting.\n\nDo you think going for WGU after high school would be worth it?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,  I'm two classes away from graduation. Looking to be done in the next month if it goes right. On my last hard course being D335. Seems much more straight forward compared to intro to applications (didn't grasp SQL too well but got er done). I completed the first 5-6 chapters of Zybooks material. Got through 14 sections of Angela Yus 100 days of programming. Went through all the Chapter 34 labs and starting to rinse and repeat the labs till they are on the back of my hand. I have had my studying cut out for me and have been going hard at it but I really want to pass the OA on the first try. What tips and extra tricks would you all recommend for the Python OA? I know it's extremely similar to the pre-asessment which I have gone through a few times already but I want to be completely prepared. Not the hardest class I have faced by far but that doesn't mean I want it to drag out. I'm ready to be done with it. 3 weeks of studying and I want it to pay out. Thanks WGU members \ud83d\ude04",

I\u2019ll most likely be done 2 months before my term ends. \n\nMy question is, how does the transition work? Is there anything that I need to do to make sure things go smoothly? The only thing I know is that I\u2019ll be assigned a new program mentor. \n\nMy employer already covered the BS portion, so what would need to be done for them to cover the MS portion? \n\nI couldn\u2019t seem to find a clear answer when searching, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello, was on the 6th class in my degree which also happened to be my first WGU OA. After the test, but before I received my score, I was asked to do the survey. Fine, whatever, so since I had waited an extra hour and they could not register my camera and were very rigid, I clicked one of the \"mid\" options as an evaluation. At that point, the proctor, still connected, watching me cleared her throat. The classic \"ahem\" sound, as if to make me aware that my results were in her hands. It worked, you go got a perfect score on the survey. \n\nWhat I want to ask is, isn't this a really scummy practice? You can still see my screen, interact with me and even control the computer, why not just fill out the survey using your Remote capabilities at this point? \n\nI mean, an easy remedy to this is to email the survey for honest feedback, and NOT have it say \"rate your proctor\" it should be \"rate your experience\", the experience is not necessarily the proctors fault. That would be the answer, unless honest feedback isn't what is desired.\n\nIt was worse than when PeopleCert tried to sell me a membership before exiting the proctored exam, yes, they do that. \n\nAnyways, on to my next OA, we'll see if this scenario plays out again.",

I told her I\u2019ve completed 10 courses on Sophia for the degree I chose already, I haven\u2019t sent that transcript over yet, she still told me I needed to do it. I previously went to a university in 2016 and dropped out so I had a horrible GPA. That transcript was sent over so maybe that\u2019s why she said that because I was under the impression that if I completed courses on Sophia I could get in? \nI was also shocked to see that the pathway courses show that they take 2 months to complete, she told me I have until December 5th to complete the pathway course. I unfortunately am having surgery in about a week that will require a pretty long recovery. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be doing any schoolwork until January. Can I just tell my counselor no to the pathway course or is it necessary? \nTIA! ",

They are just the messenger you can always escalate or ask for it to be reviewed again. Also, you can ask for them to exclude your 2016 transcripts, but you would have to have a good reason, I took one course from Debbie G Academy and transferred it in to WGU and gotten no problem.

But I tell myself the extra sleep, outdoor time, and rest on the weekends/after work is me accomplishing stuff still.....recharging the battery so I can hit the ground running after my break. Then when you start again, start with a 10 minute daily study session as your goal. Often I end up stretching it to hours once I get going, but I'm not required to. Just show up for 10 minutes and if you're still burnt out get some more rest and try again the next day.",

Near the end of the OA, the proctor logged out, and I got sent to the survey screen. I waited 20 minutes before deciding to exit out, and when I did, it shot me back to the test. So I rushed through the end, which is probably why I failed\u2026 but yeah, send help. \n\nSide note: Just a few tips\u2014make sure you really read through the answers carefully before choosing one. Sometimes the difference is something small, like 0.08 versus 0.80, and when you\u2019re rushing, it\u2019s easy to miss. Know the concepts like average rate of change, concave up, concave down, and percent increase/decrease. Also, remember that if it says \u201clinear,\u201d it means a constant rate of change, and sometimes the answer is actually hidden in the question itself.

I say tricky, not hard, because you\u2019ll come across questions that will refer to things like Remote Desktop and have options A and B be RMM or VNC with the only indicator being that the user is using file explorer. It\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s tricky. Also, STUDY PBQ\u2019S. I got 4 PBQ\u2019s right from the beginning, and they\u2019re not insanely difficult, but they do take time. When you test, leave PBQs for the end so you can really focus and lock in on them. I didn\u2019t touch any material outside of the course material labs + certmaster learn/practice. If I could study again, I would\u2019ve done LEARN/PRACTICE/PBQ practice/PRACTICE TESTS.\nGood luck to you, the biggest thing is don\u2019t overthink it, and trust in your abilities.",

The Webcam must be forward-facing and at eye level to ensure your head and shoulders are visible within the webcam. The webcam must remain in front of you and cannot be placed at an angle. Webcam filters are not allowed (for example, Apple's 'Reactions'*\n\nso there ya have it. I'm also asking because I think using the native cam could reduce issues I've had in the past with Pearson's nightmare proctors. There was one time a proctore interrupted me in the middle of a PBQ and spent 10 minutes trying to adjust my external cam to their liking (i didnt get the time back and ended up failing the exam for a second time).\n\nAlso, this is for clarification considering WGU requires us to have an external cam per policy if i remember correctly.

SQL is 1000% not a programming language. \n\n\"SQL, or Structured Query Language, is often described as a query language rather than a full programming language. Here are some key points that clarify why SQL is categorized this way:\n\nPurpose: SQL is designed specifically for managing and manipulating relational databases. Its primary functions include querying data, updating records, inserting new data, and deleting data. This narrow focus on database operations distinguishes it from general-purpose programming languages.\n\nDeclarative Nature: SQL is a declarative language, meaning that it allows users to specify what they want to do (e.g., retrieve data) without needing to define how to do it (e.g., the step-by-step process to retrieve that data). In contrast, most programming languages are imperative, requiring explicit instructions for control flow and state management.\n\nControl Structures: SQL lacks many features commonly found in programming languages, such as loops, conditionals, and variable declarations (though some SQL dialects have procedural extensions that introduce these concepts). This limits its ability to handle complex algorithms and logic typically associated with programming.\n\nLimited Functionality: While SQL can perform calculations and data transformations, it does not support many features of traditional programming languages, such as object-oriented programming, error handling, and extensive libraries for tasks outside of database management.\n\nIntegration with Other Languages: SQL is often embedded within other programming languages (like Python, Java, or C#) to handle database interactions. In these contexts, SQL serves as a specialized tool rather than a standalone programming environment.\n\nIn summary, SQL is not considered a programming language in the traditional sense due to its specific focus on data manipulation, its declarative nature, and its limited control structures. It excels in its domain but does not encompass the broader capabilities of general-purpose programming languages.\"",

It is a language , as I explained ,  a declarative and single scope language , that\u2019s how\u2019s called .\n\nHere are some reasons why people may overlook SQL as a programming language:\n\n\t1.\tDeclarative vs. Imperative: SQL is a declarative language, meaning you state what you want, not how to achieve it. In contrast, most programming languages are imperative, where you write step-by-step instructions. Declarative languages can feel less like \u201cprogramming\u201d because you\u2019re not telling the computer each step of the process.\n\n\t2.\tLimited Scope: SQL is domain-specific, designed for interacting with databases. It\u2019s not intended for building applications, managing memory, or performing many other tasks that general-purpose languages handle.\n\n\t3.\tNo Traditional Constructs: While SQL has control flow constructs (like CASE statements), it lacks some programming staples like loops and extensive conditionals. This limited set of constructs makes it feel less powerful for application logic.\n\n\t4.\tPerception and Experience: Many people learn SQL purely as a tool for querying data, so they see it as more of a query language than a full programming language. Often, SQL is the first \u201clanguage\u201d that people learn, and they don\u2019t perceive it as \u201creal\u201d programming compared to other languages they might learn later.\n\nDespite these differences, SQL is indeed a programming language. It has syntax, allows for complex operations, can perform calculations, and manipulates data \u2014 all core aspects of programming. Plus, SQL scripts can become complex enough to manage data workflows, optimize performance, and automate tasks within databases, showing it has programming capabilities, even if in a specialized context.\n\nYou don\u2019t liking it or accepting, it\u2019s different . It doesn\u2019t change the fact , that it is .",

I thought I'd put together some really quick tips I used to get this knocked out.\n\n1. Check the FAQ's that the instructor emailed out, there's a word doc that has some great context for what they're looking for in there. There's also a video that covers a few important points on the network diagram, for example how simple it can really be. I kept the same level of detail on mine as what they gave you (subnets, etc) but I'm not totally sure if that was required. \n2. Don't worry about the labs, they're not graded and might not help that much for this assignment. I didn't look at them.\n3. It could be you are overcomplicating it. These two posts helped me a lot:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/1f1yr1h/comment/lkfxd9p/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/1f1yr1h/comment/lkfxd9p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/140ixnc/d482\\_secure\\_network\\_design\\_pa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/140ixnc/d482_secure_network_design_pa/)\n\nFor some context, I have 7 years in cyber and about 15 in IT, and it took me something like 12 hours of work and 13 pages (to include title page, table of contents, and works cited). I wasn't totally confident it was going to be right, but make sure everything you write is exactly from the rubric.\n\nOn to D486!\n\n",

So you essentially have like 3 to choose from GDPR, HIPAA, and Sarbanes\u2013Oxley. Also security control there are so many zero trust, Segmentation, defense in depth etxc \n\nDon't over complicate the network topology I did that and took me a week. I'll give you an advice now. No need for the printers. If you need a reason why well printers are a liability in terms of security and maintenance. \n\nHope this helps.

We agreed to do email check-ins. So I feel I definitely set the tone there. Now that my work schedule is not so busy, I am wondering if I am underutelizing a valuable resource.\n\nSo tell me, what is your mentor like, and what sort of interactions do you have with them? In what ways have they helped you along?",

He did email me to ask me how I was doing, I am nowhere near the mountains. I'm pretty much on autopilot and doing the classes I need to be doing, I check in with him let him know that. He knows that if I need him I will text or call him or email him. I'm down to four classes left and two of them are compedia certifications. If I ever have to email a professor or an instructor I always do carbon copy him on the email. Just so he's looped in. I'm also in my 40s so he sees he doesn't have to handhold me all the time.

It was always motivating for me when I saw people post, so here I am!\n\nThis is a long time in the making. Something that felt like it would never end and I finally reached my goal! \n\nFor some reference, I am in my late 30s. Been in and out of schools and circumstances always pulled me away for a period of time. WGU was the perfect school to use what I\u2019ve learned from those prior schools to cruise through. I transferred in 57 CUs. I started February of 2024 and completed 2.5 months into the second term. I started strong in the first few months knocking out about 9 classes. Then I hit the Computer Architecture and Operating Systems combo that really slowed me down and honestly just burned me out. Took probably 3 months to complete those 2 courses but a good 2 months was really doing nothing. The final 7 classes after those went by, I completed in about a month or so. I saw the finish and gave it my all, basically staying up every night until midnight. I do work a full time job, I have a family I support, I have a home to maintain, I have a life. Looking back, I question how I even managed to squeeze in the school work, but you find a way!\n\nI will leave with well wishes to all of those continuing, starting, or right at the finish line. Just keep at it, no matter how long it takes, then end will come!!!",

I dragged my feet for a month on DM2 but took me 2 weeks of actual studying to get done. DSA2 only took me a week, maybe a little less. The 2 long courses for me were Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. They were far enough into my degree plan that I was really burned out at that point and just dragging my feet. It\u2019s very reading and definition heavy and you really need to understand most of the material at least at a high level. I work quickly when I have a defined goal set. When the class is just \u201cstudy\u201d in general, I tend to lose focus easily and that\u2019s what happened to me. Realistically, you can probably get them both done in a month or so, I took 3. And probably a good month and a half of that was not doing anything at all. The rest of the courses were generally a week or 2, sometimes less. I will also say Data Management Foundations was another one I dragged my feet, again, just very dry material and I lost focus.",

If I were to do it over, I\u2019d probably get the CA and OSfP out of the way early because I was the most motivated right off the bat and would be more willing to read through 12 chapters of notes and hundreds of terms. Though, I\u2019m not entirely sure if a mentor will throw you into that right off the bat. DM2 was hard, but it\u2019s much more involved because you are working out each problem. \n\nAs for DM1 and DSA1, I took DM1 at SDC due to hearing that it feeds well into DM2 and that is definitely true. Certainly still a lot to learn in DM2 and you have to learn it either way, it worked well taking it through SDC though. I\u2019ve heard the WGU version is just fine as well though. DSA1 I decided to take at WGU and felt it was a solid base. The order I took them in was DM1, DSA1, DM2, DSA2. There are definitely portions of DSA1 that will help you understand what\u2019s going on in DM2, something to keep in mind.",

I\u2019m pursuing this degree because I\u2019d like to keep moving up and have seen firsthand that people my job level and above (and some below) have masters degrees (MHA, MBA). Plus I get some tuition reimbursement so that made it more enticing.

Tier 1 took over while my Mentor is away but had no info to share so booked an appt & hope he provides guidance. Afraid my C213 knowledge will disappear before I can get an answer, and intentionally ordered my degree plan so C213/214 would be sequential.\n\nAnybody have an update on old and new C214s for those w/ a Nov 30 grad goal?!",

Since my employer will cover my tuition for a master\u2019s degree, I'd like to seize this opportunity to further my education. My goals are to enhance my knowledge in ML/AI, potentially transition into data science or analytics, and create more career opportunities for future promotions or with other employers.\n\nBased on my research, I'm considering either Georgia Tech's OMSA or WGU's MSDA program, but I\u2019m struggling to choose the best fit and want to avoid starting a program only to withdraw later.\n\nGaTech\u2019s OMSA program has a stronger reputation and is known to be more rigorous than WGU\u2019s MSDA, with a heavier emphasis on math (as I understand it). Since it\u2019s been over a decade since I was in school, I\u2019d need a refresher in statistics, linear algebra, and calculus, as GaTech recommends. I expect the OMSA program would require more time and effort to complete than WGU\u2019s program due to its difficulty and the extra study time needed.\n\nOn the other hand, WGU\u2019s program might suit me better since I could pick up the math along the way (Please correct me if I'm wrong), and with my background in SQL and Python, I might finish it faster.\n\nConsidering my current role as a data engineer (primarily building and maintaining data pipelines and dashboards) and my goals (i.e. advancing within my career, building ML/AI skills, exploring data science/analytics, and opening doors to other employers) would WGU\u2019s MSDA be the more practical choice? I don\u2019t want to invest too much effort into OMSA if the ROI doesn\u2019t meet my expectations.",

                "content": "Alright so I actually have some first hand experience with this. I have been a data scientist for about four years now. I have a BA in Maths and good foundations of data science/statistics/ML after attending an intense coding bootcamp in 2021.\n\nI started the OMSA program at Georgia Tech in 2022. The effort required for one class was personally too much for me. Yes it was hard, assignments were due weekly and tests were all proctored and not straightforward. \n\nI switched to WGU because as a mom with two young kids and building my career in data science, OMSA was asking for too much of my time with ROI not being for at least 5 years. I started WGU November 2023 and am six classes in with five left. This degree has been quite easy for me but, it is also what you make of it. I chose to zoom through some classes I knew like the back of my hand while in other classes I challenged myself to write papers on algorithms I was less familiar with (e.g. doing a paper on NaiveBayes because I didn\u2019t know as much about it as KNN, using stats models framework as opposed to sklearn like I do at work). \n\nI\u2019m not personally a fan of the structure and heavy emphasis on data camp, so I do with my school work what I do at work, google, research, and more google. I love it. WGU is very hands on and fairly realistic to the work place (except for the ridiculously clean data set they provided, I will say). \n\nI recently changed companies who initially considered me because of the MSDA in progress on my resume and in return I did do well on the interview and landed the job. So it did help as far as ROI just in title and results show the school name wasn\u2019t as important (I had two other job offers this year). I absolutely love my job and have learned so much.\n\nIn the end, I wanted to go for a masters degree primarily for job stability and to learn and enhance my knowledge of math, statistics and machine learning. So far WGU has done that for me. Yes it has been very easy, but that relieves some stress and invites more time for researching my papers and having fun while learning how to better optimize my code and enhance my statistical knowledge.\n\nOMSA sounds like an amazing and challenging program as well. It just did not suit me and my needs at this time in my life and felt like it was leaning more on math/coding abstract theory than application. My husband is current doing the OMCS and loves his program, so it just depends on you.\n\nAnother thing you should look into is micro masters degrees on EdX. Georgia Tech offers the OMSA micro masters - it\u2019s only 4 classes (including the one I took) and you can switch to the OMSA full program from there.",

The point of the WGU MSDA is to execute a program that does math for you, and they (at least in the prior version of the program) don't bother teaching you much of that underlying math. There will definitely be a few smaller concepts that will jog your memory or some such, but definitely not anything more complex than some probabilities or graphing exponential curves. That's not to say that WGU's MSDA isn't a good program, but it's definitely not going to be as thorough in its coverage of material, especially with the incentive to finish faster to avoid paying for more terms.",

I come from a math background and I've used mostly none of it in this program, perhaps with the exception of knowing what certain statistical terms mean that I could have easily just googled. The programs do all the math behind the scenes.\n\nAs for advice, OP, I'd say if you are self motivated and plan to work quickly or don't want to give too much mental energy to class, WGU is a good choice because it's not going to be as rigorous. Personally I'm doing this program to check the box to get a master's degree so I can change fields and so far it seems great for that. If you're looking for rigor, a challenge, more time spent in class, etc. I've heard great things about Georgia Tech. I think the key here is how much time and energy you want to spend on school.",

I went to a private liberal arts college and I see all other schools the same tbh unless again it's like Stanford or Harvard or some shit. I work for a f50 company and even places like Google I've noticed they like to actually hire people from smaller countries or schools to help give opportunity to those in less privileged backgrounds (i.e. not already rich with connections).\n\nAlso salary wise just having a masters you'll have more promotion and salary opportunities.",

Make +6 figures, fully remote and hardly work that much (but the work we do is super fun and interesting). If you want to have a more elite recognition & background and be around those types of people, just know those people aren't always in the best places or opportunities. \n\nSome of the smartest and well off people I know have random ass backgrounds and do not flaunt their elite background. Honestly if you're joining a team that takes that as a main point of concern, it's likely male dominated and toxic with a bro/fratty dynamic. A degree is basically the bare minimum now, equivalent to a GED to even get a job. It doesn't even matter how or where you get it at this point. All that matters is internships connections and pipeline programs. I.e. Google has relationships with certain schools that teach them topics google needs advancement in and then hires those people",

        "selftext": "I need to put a huge ***\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*DISCLAIMER\\*\\*\\*\\*\\**** at the top of this that I have worked in software development for almost 4 years now. I knew a few frontend frameworks going into this, so learning Angular for the first time wasn't a difficult process. \n\nI have a spreadsheet that I use to track my classes. I include an \"estimated time to pass\" and \"actual time to pass\" column so I can see how I'm doing. My time estimate is typically pulled from what people are saying on reddit. I put my estimate at 2 full weeks for this course because of the horror stories in this sub. And I spent less than 3 hours working on it, and wait 1.5 days for my submission to come back. I'm going to try to explain this, without giving away any code, to try and ease your minds. Hopefully it's approved and not taken down for whatever reason. Apologies for the long post. \n\nOkay so you need to connect to GitLab which can be confusing. Hopefully you've taken Version Control by now and are familiar with running commands in your terminal. I don't like Gitlab personally, but it is what is it. Note that you have to remember to make commits after completing each section. I forgot to do this because I was in the groove of coding and at the end I had to individually stage each file and make like 8 commits before pushing. Total pain, don't be me. Commit after each section. \n\nOnto the actual assignment. Create your Angular project using the CLI. I was confused and thought when I cloned in the GitLab repo, I would be getting a \"prebuilt\" project. So create your angular project in the directory that you forked the GL repo from. Your job is to turn a map interactive. This map is in an SVG. Click the link, and copy the code directly from the browser. If you don't know how to do that, just inspect element and look at the code to copy it. In your new Angular project, create a folder. I used Angular 18.2.11 and since I'm not an Angular expert, Idk what the default file structure looks like, I can't tell you exactly where to put yours. Mine went in my /app directory. I only created 3 new files for this. An html file, a typescript file (It says Javascript but you'll be learning typescript because Angular), and a css file. ONLY 3 FILES NEED TO BE CREATED. Do not overthink this part. \n\nLooking at this project can be daunting if you have limited to no coding experience, or frontend experience. But you're likely in this program to become a software engineer, so think like a software engineer. Break this project down into smaller easier to solve problems. First, how do you get a map to render? Great, the map shows up. How do you get 1-N number of columns to display your content? Look that up and put placeholder data. Especially if your new to frontend, make a div and put a border: 1px solid red; like the rest of us working on frontend nonsense. Cool, now you have 2 columns side by side. Now how do you make the map interactive? You need to hover right? Look up how to make an element do something when your cursor hovers over it. At this point, it'll likely be the whole map. Say you have the map on the left side, red bordered div on the right side. Can you change the border color of the right div when you hover over the map? Great, you have some functionality there. What does an SVG have? A bunch of paths right? Those paths point to countries. How can you iterate over a collection of information? Great, now you've solved that and can highlight each country when you hover over it. Now for the tricky part, gathering data from the API and displaying the contents. \n\nThis is probably the trickiest part because working with APIs can be a pain. Read the documentation on the API first and foremost. Learning to read, and comprehend documentation will be instrumental to your development career. Practice it now. Look up how to make API calls in Angular (remembering to specify your version of Angular, and the method of calling the API this assignment wants you to use). Practice pull all the data. How do you know you've gathered data? Look up how to handle API calls with logging and handling errors. Once you have the data, you just need to learn/look up how to pass data between the ts and html files. \n\nThis is an extremely long post and I apologize for that. I've mentored a few engineers in my career, although I'm pretty early on. But these problem solving skills are going to be crucial to your success in this field. I have experience so taking 3ish hours on this class isn't anything impressive. It's probably not that impressive actually and should've taken less time given my experience. If you're new, I don't think you should try to fully speed run this class and finish in a day. But I also don't want you to be stuck in this class for months like some people here have mentioned. It should take probably 15-20 hours with minimal experience. Far less if you have more experience. What you should be taking away from this course is problem solving abilities. You won't become an expert at Angular or typescript from this assignment. This is not a project that's worth putting on your resume or portfolio. It's incredibly simple and would likely be considered a barebones project with basically zero functionality. It's assumed you know how to do stuff like this when you apply for a job. \n\nMy closing advice. For this assignment, and every other assignment you have to do here you should be able to follow this approach until it clicks. Open the assignment, and read through what it is that you need to do. Write it all out on a piece of paper in bullet points. Go through each bullet point and ask yourself what you need to do to solve that. Break it down into 2-3 smaller problems that are easier to manage. If you can break down one big problem into 3 problems, you can solve each problem easily. Each problem solved is momentum and deepens your understanding. Once you've solved all 3, you'll likely have the forth problem of connecting all 3 solutions. But that will only further deepen your understanding. \n\nGood luck with this course everyone, and remember, you're here to (most likely) become a software engineer. Nobody said it would be easy, but you can succeed if you put in the work. ",

He started with WGU when they were a small office in the basement of a building in holladay and like 15 staff. He really saw the vision for what the university could be and worked really hard to see it come together. The tuition thing has been addressed but he raised it I believe only twice the entire 20 years he worked at WGU. WGU was never supposed to be just another online college - it was meant to be a college where people could prove they knew the content and be able to attend and afford to attend when they otherwise would not have been able to. He was a professional. He felt deeply about WGU but never cried in meetings. He got paid for his job really well but I wouldn't say it was excessive. He did not have a driver or have boxes at eccles theatre. He truly cared about WGU employees and students. He valued employees that stayed for long times and made all the employees feel valued and needed. I miss him too. \n\nI think if Scott cared he could course correct but I don't think he cares. I think this is more a business to him than anything else.",

I feel as if they word something\u2019s in a strange way from time to time that I can\u2019t determine which company I\u2019m also recording a transaction for. I think I really needed to slow down and examine the questions a bit harder but I don\u2019t get the point in having an answer be one word off.  But they got me on the pa with a question about FOB like that. So j imagine my impatience  and taking the test at 1 am also attributed to that. I scheduled for 11.10 pm but the proctor had no clue how to start the test so I didn\u2019t get in till 12:45 I was honestly irate that apparently after 30 minutes there isn\u2019t a switch over or someone else coming in to support him. Went on a side tangent ::::mb I just feel like I need to do some more difficult questions to really cement in what I do understand but in different words",

I am planning to start the bachelor's program on Dec 1 and really want to accelerate and finish in 1 term.\n\nSo after I read all these posts about Sophia I thought I would be able to knock off some of the 21 classes remaining there, but looks like only one is eligible for transfer (Finance Skills for Managers), which makes it not worth it.\n\nCan someone with more experience please check my classes and let me know if I got this right and I can't transfer any of them from Sophia? I am not interested in doing Study.com.\n\nAlso, do you think it is possible to complete these in 1 term, considering I work full time in accounting, so I have experience and have taken some of the accounting classes in my AAS which now I will have to re-take? I'll be able to study maybe 2-3 hrs at night and on weekends.\n\nTIA!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9gj06hz1ezd1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=af00e56e6a73b0fd8abb685ce82376761e62ebe9\n\n",

I think the system (online) is simply not for me and I need someone right next to me explaining me how to do this and that and not having to be on a video/phone call with an instructor every time I need help with something. 35 credits left is literally nothinf but still if I am struggling with D100 chances are I will struggle even more with Intermediate Accounting and will need a professor right next to me. What is WGU\u2019s policy when it comes to dropping/ withdrawing? Do i still pay for the full term?\nThanks",

I can honestly say I wasn\u2019t enjoying accounting at all and I was really struggling but it really did start to click for me eventually. I will tell you that I have never been so proud of myself for sticking it out and graduating. I did work really hard, maybe the hardest I have ever worked in my life, it\u2019s so easy to get distracted, I didn\u2019t take any shortcuts, I didn\u2019t accelerate, I just had to put my head down and do all of the work.

First thing that popped up: \"Refund Policies:**Students with a withdrawal date that occurs up through the completion of 60% of a term are eligible for a refund of a prorated portion of the tuition and library fee**. Students with a withdrawal date that occurs after 60% of the term has been completed are not eligible for a refund.\" This is directly from the WGU \"Enrollment Agreement\" that you signed. \n\n  \nWith that said - I think you should try to complete the term that you're currently in then reassess afterwards. Maybe take time contemplating if leaving WGU would be the best decision for you while taking a break from course work. WGU isn't for everyone and you should not be ashamed if it isn't for you. Disconnect yourself from social media, touch grass and really think about it.\n\n  \nTLDR: You can get a prorated refund if you are currently 60% or less on your term. Take time to think about your decision if you want inevitably leave WGU.",

It is online but no proctored exams.  There are milestones and Assessments.  They have 8 week flat terms six times a year for $1700.  They are competency based and you can go as fast as you can.  You can transfer in courses even after you start.  I would consider applying and start the transferring process.  \n\nDid you transfer anything in from Sophia to WGU?",

Product costs and period costs \u26ab\n c. CVP - Cost Volume Profit break even calculation \u26ab \nd. Know your H and V analysis, redo this unit test until you get 100% \u26ab \ne. Know how to make a column chart to their specifications, redo this unit test until you get 100%.

If it\u2019s audit or tax, a bachelor/MAcc/CPA would be preferred.

The test itself wasn't too bad but the experience was so bad I got super nervous.\n\nThe first unit in the second half is accounting for leases. I struggled so hard with this section. Eventually I took a break from 105 and completed a couple other classes I had this term before diving back in. The subsequent sections don't build on Leases, so I skipped that section and left it for last.\n\nI read through all the course material and did all of the practice problems. Honestly, I found the practice problems with the notes to be a lot more understandable than the text. This was especially true when I went back to the leases section. \n\nIf you have the opportunity, do the cohort with Premuroso. It finally made Leases click for me and really helped with what to add/subtract for the statement of cash flows. He had one slide that I printed and taped to my wall, which helped a lot.\n\nThis class took me longer than any other in my degree program. I have 5 classes left and 8 weeks in the term.

        "selftext": "Fair Warning - alignment is only somewhat there between the OA and the Pre-Assessment with this one, and the OA seemed a lot harder (although I also did better than I thought I did after checking my score). In general, the Pre-Assessment is a lot more \"conceptual\" than the OA, which felt more calculation-heavy.\n\n**Tips On The OA:**\n\n* Know how Bond calculations and journal entries work, including what counts as an expenditure related to Bonds and how to record premiums. You will actually need to calculate the amortized premium or discount on a Bond purchase for the first payment, so you can show the proper journal entry.\n* The Non-Profit section was far more difficult than the PA, with questions related to how to record and display stuff like program revenue/costs versus supporting costs/revenue, what types of revenue, etc.\n* Make sure you know what types of funds have which financial statements, and how they're shown in the Government-Wide Financial Statements.\n* Fewer questions on this one versus the PA when it came to the ACFR, but you still need to know the structure of it and what goes where generally.\n* You need to have a good understanding of how revenues and expenditures are recorded for governmental funds, including stuff like vacations, sick leave, etc. Hint - for a governmental fund, expenditures on vacation pay are \"pay go\" (IE you only record the amount expended in the period, so if an employee used 10 hours of vacation leave, it would be 10 hours times their hourly pay).\n* Still a fair amount of general conceptual questions, like \"what type of fund uses what basis of accounting\" and so forth.\n* Make sure you know the three methods of determining impairment loss on assets, especially Reservation Cost and Units. This was far tougher than the PA, which basically gives you the answer almost compared to these.\n* **You must ABSOLUTELY be careful to keep an eye out as to whether it's describing a Governmental Fund using Modified Accrual, or one of the other ones using Full Accrual.** \n\nHere are my scores:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4kw1k0t77zd1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=51bf84cfa52757ada8228c93eef2ddbd66ed432f\n\nLike I said, I did a lot better on this that I thought I did.\n\n**Thoughts on the Class:**\n\nThis class really doesn't have a lot of material to work with. It's basically just the textbook, the quizzes after each chapter, and the A and B Unit Tests for each Unit. There's no recorded cohorts\\*, and the Powerpoints are from the publisher and kind of useless. Best you can do is thoroughly read the chapters, take the quizzes, take the \"A\" tests, take the PA, then study more and take the \"B\" tests to prepare for the OA.\n\n\\* Although they do occasionally have instructor drop-in sessions in the Learning Lounge, which are cool. Clint Dillard is great as a course instructor if you get him - I've had him for multiple courses in the MACC, and he's helpful and very quick to respond if you ask him a question by email. \n\n**How I Did the Class:**\n\nThis class took 15 days, although I didn't really get any coursework done on Halloween so it was more like 14 days. I studied about 30-40 hours per week, generally aiming to complete a chapter each day and occasionally doing more (some of the later chapters - and units - are shorter than the really long early ones). I took *lots* of Memory Notes that aren't meant to be read later, but which you use to anchor your learning from the reading.  Writing front and back on each page, I used about 4-5 of those 70 page cheap notebooks. \n\n",
